As a Remote Sensing Intern contributing to an international research initiative led by Tel Aviv University, Israel, 
I’m working on the Digital Village project—an effort aimed at transforming irrigation practices across Punjab. 
This project is not just a standalone analysis, but part of a larger movement focused on promoting sustainable water use in Indian agriculture. 
Our core objective is to evaluate evapotranspiration (ET) patterns to understand how much water is actually consumed by crops, 
and compare that with the water being applied by farmers.

I've gathered and analyzed ET data from a sample of farms selected out of 1,000 marked plots, representing a variety of irrigation methods—Direct Seeded Rice (DSR), 
Transplanted Rice (TPR), and Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD). The data, sourced from the WaPOR satellite platform, spans from May 2024 to June 2025, 
and is being used to assess water efficiency across farm types. The findings from this project are expected to guide policy, influence agricultural practices, 
and contribute to scalable solutions for reducing excess water usage in farming. I am currently focused on the data analytics component—studying the relationship between ET 
and on-ground water levels to generate actionable insights for the farming community and stakeholders.
